# **Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which **Get plus code** ("the App") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the App. This privacy policy applies to the App and all products and services offered by **Get plus code**.

## **Data Collection and Use**

**The Get plus code app does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to our servers or any third-party servers.** All processing of your location data happens exclusively on your device.

To provide the core functionality of checking your current location, the App requires and requests the **android.permission.ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION** permission. When you use the App, your current geographical location data (latitude, longitude) is used for the following on-device functions:

* Displaying your current location on a map.  
* Generating a Plus Code for your location.

We want to be clear: Your location data is used only for the immediate purpose of generating and displaying the Plus Code and is not stored or saved anywhere.

## **Log Data**

In the event of an error in the App, we may collect data and information (through third-party services like crash reporting tools) called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our service, the time and date of your use of the service, and other statistics. This information is used solely for debugging and improving the App's performance and stability and is not linked to any personal user data.

## **Sharing Your Information**

The App does not share your location data or any other personal information with any third parties. The app provides a user-initiated option for you to manually share your location details (latitude, longitude, and Plus Code) with others. This action is performed entirely at your discretion, and we have no access to or control over the information you choose to share or with whom you share it.

## **Security**

We value your trust in providing us with your personal information, and we take commercially acceptable steps to protect it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## **Children's Privacy**

The App is not intended for users under the age of 13\. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13\. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with any information, please contact us.

## **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
